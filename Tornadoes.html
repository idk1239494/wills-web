        <h1>Reconstructing the Dreamspace V accident:<br>What happened at Riverside Park, second by second</h1>
        <p>Published February 17, 2026</p>

<br><p><i>Dreamspace V</i> was a large inflatable art piece created by artist Maurice Agis. It was a colorful installation that allowed visitors to enter into what was intended to feel like another dimension. In July of 2006, the structure came loose of its moorings from a strong gust of wind and began flying through the air with people still inside. By the time the dust settled, 2 women lay dead and another 19 would be injured.</p>

<h1>_________________________</h1>
<h1>Who was Maurice Agis?</h1>

<br><p>Maurice Agis was a British sculptor and artist whose Dreamspace projects drew the involvement and work of various schools and art institutions all over Britain. His disillusionment with galleries and museums led him to create his signature "interactive works" in the 1960s. </p>

<h1><i>Dreamspace V</i></h1>

<br><p><i>Dreamspace V</i> was a large PVC-based inflatable walk-in art piece. It was part of a series first commissioned in 1996 during the European City of Culture celebrations in Copenhagen, Denmark. Premiering in 2004, it was half the length of a football field; 165 feet in width and length (50 m) and ~16 feet in height (5 m). Its build involved 156 units, or ‘cells,’ that were separated into 4 multicolored groups and interconnected and arranged into an abstract design, all of which were either red, yellow, green, blue, or white. At the entrance, there were 2 large domes for visitors to pay, dress, and enter the structure. Once inflated, visitors could walk through the seemingly infinite tunnels and voids created between the units and experience a sense of awe, amazement, nostalgia, or surrealism. The requirements were to wear socks while inside and to wear gowns while inside to enhance the overall experience, or, according to Agis, to ‘become part of the artwork’ and were told to ‘lose themselves inside it.’ Dreamspace had overall positive reviews from people of any age, and the concept of it had been done multiple times in the previous 10 years by Agis. The arts council gave the green light for the installation being presented to the public in multiple towns, including a festival in Chester-le-Street, allowing Agis to bring his art to a wider public. Before the installation at Chester-le-Street, Dreamspace had made a stop in Brouhaha International Festival in Liverpool temporarily. While in Liverpool though, a few hours before it was meant to open, vandals entered the grounds and slashed the PVC structure with knives, resulting in deflation and causing a delayed opening for repairs. During its stay in Liverpool, it was also closed multiple times due to stronger winds than anticipated, with visitors inside asked to leave. Following the act of vandalism, 3 of the inflatable pillars created by the units were replaced and Dreamspace was scheduled to move to it’s next location: Riverside Park, County Durham, England.</p>

<h1>The Dreamspace V disaster</h1>
<p>August 19 1845</p>

<br><p>On July 22nd, 2006, Dreamspace was officially installed in Riverside Park, Chester-le-Street as part of a festival. The inflatable structure Agis had installed in Chester-le-Street was the fifth of the Dreamspace series, hence the ‘V’ in ‘Dreamspace V.’ Once installed, it had been moored to the ground with 31 stakes, 9 less than the standard safety requirement. No problems arose on the 22nd of July, because the day was not particularly windy. However, the same cannot be said for July 23rd. On July 23rd, before the structure had even opened, a cleaner inside Dreamspace noted that the floor of Dreamspace was beginning to ‘ripple.’ After opening to the people of the festival, the same thing began happening. Agis himself was present at the time, and he was informed about this, to which he responded to attach more stakes and tethers to the structure. Unfortunately, what people failed to realize is that the ‘rippling’ was a result of wind getting underneath the structure causing it to slightly lift. Around at the same time, 68-year-old Elizabeth Collings visited the area with the rest of her family. They had originally seen the inflatable in the distance and curiosity got the best of them. Elizabeth’s grandson was eager to enter, while Elizabeth and the others were a bit more reluctant but eventually Elizabeth did go in, joking that she was going to ‘find peace and serenity.’ Elizabeth’s husband and daughter sat at a table nearby. After conversing for an unspecified amount of time, the ripples inside Dreamspace were beginning to become more pronounced and violent, until the entire structure itself was beginning to move. Elizabeth’s husband, noticing this, thought it was some sort of carnival ride and stated he wished he had gone on. Susan Campbell, Elizabeth’s daughter, turned her head to see the structure beginning to move, to which she simply responded, "It’s not a ride."</p>

<p><i>Dreamspace at Riverside Park</i></p>

<p>At 11:42:17 A.M., the Dreamspace structure began to lift off the ground, starting from the rear and moving up to the front. In front of hundreds of people, the inflatable structure folded over on itself and began hurdling through the air to the northeast, almost crushing multiple people. Bodies were observed falling out of the structure that was now moving through the air at alarming speeds. The structure crossed a road before colliding with a CCTV pole at 11:42:49, yanking it backwards, unfolding it and finally ending the disaster. Agis himself had been standing at the entrance when it happened, and when he realized what was going on, he tried to hold down the structure in a desperate attempt to save his masterpiece, but it was clearly of no use, as Agis was dropped onto the ground, stunned, and could only watch as his artwork began flying through the air. His partner, Paloma Brotons, later stated she feared that Agis had been killed when he fell onto the ground. Of the ~30 people that were inside the structure, 19 people were injured. Unfortunately, Elizabeth Collings, who had been reluctant to enter the structure, suffered devastating injuries and did not survive. 38 year old Claire Furmedge, a bright mother of 2 daughters, had also been inside the structure when it lifted off and passed away. Collings and Furmedge would be the only 2 fatalities of the incident, both of which were ejected when the structure was in the air. The event had been captured by multiple cameras. What was left behind was a deflated Dreamspace and what witnesses described as a ‘field of bodies.’ EMS was called to the scene and immediately rushed those in critical condition to the hospital, and firefighters immediately began cutting open the PVC to search for survivors but found no one inside. Agis was taken away from the scene immediately in a police cruiser, and to the police he spoke of his shock and disbelief at what happened and stated that as the creator of Dreamspace itself, he had to accept responsibility for what happened.  This was not the first time something like this happened with Agis’ artwork; in 1986, during an exhibition in the German seaside town of Travemünde, his creation known as <i>Colourspace</i> broke free from its moorings during a sudden storm. Though no one had died, it was a major safety violation. Dreamspace itself had lifted on an earlier occasion, however it was not at this level of disaster. The Durham County Police seized the remains of Dreamspace and launched a lengthy investigation. Foul play was ruled out. It was determined as an accident by the investigation, as at the moment Dreamspace lifted, there was a large gust of wind that without a doubt contributed to the disaster; in CCTV footage you can observe trees go from stationary to blowing dominantly in one direction at 11:42:13. On top of this, it occurred in mid July, and the air outside was hot, and it may have caused a ‘hot air balloon’ effect as the air inside Dreamspace heated. Legal proceedings concluded that the event organizer, Brouhaha International, and the Chester-le-Street District Council were primarily responsible for the tragedy. The judge ordered Brouhaha to pay 55% and the Council to pay 45% of compensatory damages. As for Agis himself, he was tried for gross negligence and 2 manslaughter charges in 2009. Some investigators concluded that Agis had not contemplated or assessed whether the moorings for Dreamspace were adequate for the foreseeable weather conditions. However, the jury failed to reach a verdict after 11 hours, and were subsequently discharged. During the same trial, Agis was found guilty of breaching the Health and Safety of Work Act of 1974. Later, he was fined £10,000 for failing to ensure public safety. The Crown Prosecution Service decided to not pursue a retrial on the manslaughter charges, their reasoning being Agis’ age and poor health. Only 8 months after being fined, in October of 2009, Agis passed away at the age of 77 in Spain. While he had been physically ill for a while beforehand, some others speculate the anxiety caused by the legal proceedings themselves and the guilt and constant reminders of the accident itself played a role in his death, though this is unconfirmed.</p>

<h1>Reconstructing the Dreamspace disaster</h1>
<p>Febuary 22 1876</p>

<br><p>Present at Riverside Park that day was a CCTV camera set, with more than or equal to 27 security cameras being scattered throughout the park, 2 of which caught the disaster on film. The first known video is the most infamous video to exist of the accident. It was captured by a CCTV camera mounted on a large pole to offer an aerial view of the area for constant surveillance. It is the only known video to capture the initial liftoff of Dreamspace. Dreamspace, after folding over on itself, began hurdling through the air toward the pole until the sculpture violently collided with it—yanking the inflatable backwards and finally putting it to rest. The camera, rolling at 1 FPS, captured the inflatable rapidly approaching the screen, crushing a family’s picnic setup, running over a tree, until the only thing that can be seen is the rough PVC covering the camera as the inflatable snags it. The last shot it captures is the fabric wrapped around the pole beneath it. Multiple people can be seen running away in panic as the structure flies, one of which was from the picnic setup and almost got crushed by the structure themselves, visibly the last person to be caught by the camera. Its duration is 55 seconds. The second CCTV camera was setup on a different pole situated next to a parking lot. While it was turned in the direction of the parking lot for the majority of the disaster, during the latter portions, after the structure snagged the pole, the camera turned it’s lens toward the structure, either motion detected or was manually moved, and captured the structure rapidly deflating and falling backwards. It offers the widest view we have of the incident, with the entire park, the panicked crowd, and the giant Dreamspace all visible in the footage. Its duration is 39 seconds. The 2 videos can be seen below, timecoded to real time in the bottom left corner. These 2 videos were shown to the jury during court.</p>

<p>Other than the security videos, 2 people were recording the structure as it was flying through the air. The first handheld video was from a man in blue filming right behind the CCTV camera that was snagged. His video is the only video of the disaster with audio, note the wind howling and people screaming. He captures the inflatable rolling onto the ground before sliding against the ground toward him and the pole. After filming for a few seconds, he yells, and begins sprinting away. This video was featured on the news 3-4 days after the accident. The original video surfaced on Getty Images on April 26, 2017, and the video from the original source had a man voicing over the video, stating "This was the moment captured on a mobile phone, when a family day of fun turned into disaster." Its duration is 10 seconds. The original Getty Images page can be found by clicking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260216212919/https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/video/inflatable-sculpture-accident-kills-2-people-in-chester-news-footage/673574716">here. </a>The second and final video of the disaster was a handheld video filmed by an unidentified person. They were standing in the middle of the field itself and was directly in front of the structure when it took off, but only began recording when it snagged the CCTV pole. The filmer captured the immediate impact of the CCTV pole, followed by the inflatable deflating into nothing but a pile of PVC. The silent video shows the panic of the people around, as people, including the filmer, began rushing toward the inflatable to try and help the injured. It is the clearest visual of the inflatable snagging the CCTV pole and is one of the clearest videos of the accident itself. Its duration is 21 seconds. It originated from an old British news website that covered the incident. It was an Adobe Flash FLV file that failed to load on the page, and was only accessible by reviewing the source code. Its original source is more than likely now defunct or gone. One of these 2 videos were shown during court as evidence, aswell as both CCTV videos. These 2 handheld videos can be found below, timecoded to real time.</p>

<p>While these 4 videos are rare on their own, the sheer number of visitors during the festival suggest that there might still be undiscovered footage floating around in some places of the internet that have just not been uncovered yet. If this were true, they or their sources are likely now defunct. Another possibility is that home videos of the incident are rotting somewhere forgotten in people’s homes that are just waiting to either be thrown out or posted to the public. If you believe you have found new footage of the incident, or have footage of it, I highly advise you to post it online.</p>

<p>When you synchronize and stabilize these videos, it becomes clear the inflatable began traveling to the northeast and did not veer from its direction. It was in the air for approximately 37 seconds and another 13 seconds to deflate. Inertia from the CCTV pole can clearly be seen yanking the structure backwards before deflation, likely causing multiple injuries to the people inside. Deflation also may have suffocated many visitors. Below, you can watch all angles synced to real time, along with both witness videos stabilized.</p>

<p>Using this data, we can create a diagram of the accident. Below you can see this diagram. The 4 video vantage points are marked onto the satellite imagery, and the location of the Dreamspace inflatable is mapped out. The purple line starting at the center of Dreamspace is the trajectory it took when it was lifted. This data also allows us to map out the incident as it happened in real time. The inflatable initially went south, before folding and taking a sharp turn to the north, and then veered northeast toward the pole and did not change direction after this. Its trajectory can be described as a checkmark shape. You can watch the video below for a real time view of the accident. The black rhombus is the location of the Dreamspace inflatable. It is important to keep in mind the actual inflatable was much larger in size. The red triangle near the top of the video is the FOV of the security camera mounted on the pole that was struck. The red triangle near the bottom of the map is the FOV of the security camera that kept the parking lot under surveillance. Real time is indicated in the corner of the map. The 2 blue dots in the map are the entrance domes to Dreamspace.</p>

<p>Using this video, we can draw inferences that the time between the structure starting to move northeast and the impact on the CCTV pole was almost exactly 10 seconds. The distance it translated between this was 151 feet (or 45.98 meters.) Using distance/time, Dreamspace’s approximate foward speed after folding over was 10.29 mph (or 4.6 m/s) as it dragged itself across the field. From 11:42:26 to 11:42:32, Dreamspace rotated approximately 67° clockwise in a total of 6.5 seconds. Using degrees/time, Dreamspace was likely moving 10.308°/s (or 0.18 rad/s) during this timeframe. We can find the velocity of Dreamspace during this time using <i>v</i> = <i>rw</i>. Since Dreamspace was 50 meters across, its radius would be 25 meters. Its angular velocity would be 0.18 rad/s from our previous calculation. This means the velocity of Dreamspace would be equal to 25x0.18. The product of 25x0.18 is 4.5 m/s, which is very close to the previous speed calculation of 4.6 m/s. This might suggest that the gust of wind that carried Dreamspace had a more linear wind speed. Given that Dreamspace’s length and width was 50 meters and its height was 5 meters, we can infer the volume of Dreamspace was ~12,500m³ (441433.334 ft³.) The gust of wind likely would have had to be traveling ~15-25 mph (~24.14-40.24 km/h) to lift a structure of that volume. The gust was traveling to the south-southwest. Prior to the gust, winds had already been affecting Dreamspace, with winds getting underneath the structure and causing the ‘ripples’ that were observed.</p>

<p>We can better visualize the complex, maze-like interior of Dreamspace by mapping out the structure and then pinpointing where photos inside were taken. An example can be seen below, with all of the image’s FOVs in dark. The image in the center does not have an FOV because it is 360°. Another visual of the inside is a 360° video of a man named Andy Millns walking through the structure, with his camera’s position marked on the model of the structure in real time. See below.</p>

<p>An important thing to note is that Dreamspace almost never fully lifted from the ground, it was touching the ground throughout the entirety of the disaster, but it was mostly vertical. The 30 feet in the air likely comes from the first few seconds of the disaster, where the wind chasing the ‘ripples’ from before became too strong and lifted parts the structure off the ground, staring from the north side and then moving its way to lift the east side wildly off the ground. During this lift, the structure rotated. During this timeframe, the structure can be described as turned to a 45 degree angle on the pitch axis. The lifted part of the structure then clamped together, folding the structure. The 2 folds began flying through the air while a different part of the structure remained laying on the ground. As the folded portions began flying, it picked up the portions that were on the ground until the entire base was simply dragging itself against the ground, titled forward, while was the top tilted backwards. It continued this until it reached the CCTV pole, which wrapped parts of the PVC around it. Initially, the structure continued hurdling forward like nothing happened until the PVC reached it’s stretching capacity and immediately stopped the structure from progressing, the structure immediately unfolding and twisting back into a flat plain and remained vertical in the air for about 2 seconds before rapidly deflating onto the ground.</p>

<p>Potential new footage of the disaster is almost certainly still online in some places. One example is BBC’s article "Dreamspace artist was ‘negligent.’" It went over the charges Maurice Agis faced in wake of the disaster. However, below lines of text is an embedded file and text that reads "Footage of the moment Dreamspace broke free was shown to the jury." The Ruffle Flash emulator gets stuck on a loading screen trying to play the Flash file. Its duration is listed as ‘135’ in the source code. Given the context given, this video is most likely the CCTV videos. However, this could also be a unique handheld video that has not gotten the attention it deserves yet. Going into the source code shows the ID of the file is ‘embeddedPlayer_7857110.’ If you know or think you know how to find the actual video better than me, I highly recommend to try to do so. An archived version of the article can be found here: https://web.archive.org/web/20090131020735/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/7856121.stm</p>

<p>Another example of potential unique footage can be found at a separate BBC article, titled "Artist's dream for maze of colour." Published the day after the accident, it recounts the story of Maurice Agis and his Dreamspace series. Attached to it is an image of Agis inside Dreamspace, and underneath that image there is a play button with the word ‘VIDEO’ next to it, labeled ‘Sculpture tragedy.’ Clicking the button results in an error message as of 2026. The link the button leads to is http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/check/player/nol/newsid_5200000/newsid_5209000?redirect=5209016.stm&news=1&nbwm=1&bbwm=1&bbram=1&nbram=1&asb=1. This link is unfortunately not archived.

<p>The 2 fatalities during the incident were 2 women who were both visiting the area with their families. Autopsy determined the cause of death was traumatic asphyxia from being suffocated by Dreamspace and blunt force trauma when both fell from the structure onto the pavement of the pathway below. The most likely timeframe they fell from the structure was 11:42:39-11:42:52. To better understand what happened second by second, a timeline of events has been added below. The disaster itself only happened within about a minute, so the times many events happened are most likely separated by mere seconds and happened at 11:42.

<p>These timestamps, along with the real time timestamp edited into the videos, were made from the very low quality timestamps on the CCTV camera footages, seen at the very bottom. These 4 videos are the only visuals we have of the disaster as it happened in real time. Unless new footage were discovered, either from the links I added here or not, no other known video clip exists. Surprisingly enough, photos of the disaster are relatively scarce. While we mainly have videos, many "photos" of the disaster were simply stills from videos. All the photos of the disaster were taken either after Dreamspace had been neutralized and was deflating, or either after Dreamspace had been completely stabbed and deflated into nothing but PVC fabric sprawled out onto the ground, which I find unusual. You’d think it would likely be easier to pull out a phone or camera and snap a picture than to pull out a phone or camera and begin recording in the few seconds Dreamspace began flying. However, it seemed the opposite was at play here. Below, I have added every image I could find of the Dreamspace V accident.</p>

<p>While finding these images, I noticed that these 2 specific images were taken in very close proximity in time. You can tell by the position of the inflatable and by the locations of the colored cells. The one on the top was taken from the southwest, while the one on the bottom was taken from the southeast.</p>

<p>One thing I also noted is that in some photos you can see the CCTV pole that Dreamspace ultimately snagged and finally put a stop to the disaster. In a few aftermath photos is visible in the background, and in a few photos you can even see the PVC wrapped around the base of the pole. Below are 2 examples put side by side.</p>

<p>Overall, the approximate distance it traveled while guided by the wind was 368 feet, or 112.19 meters. However, we cannot do distance/time as it had speed changes during the beginning portions of the disaster.

<h1>_________________________</h1>
<h1>Taylorville, Illinois</h1>
<p>April 24 1880</p>

<br><p>This tornado formed near Taylorville, Illinois, moved northeast and struck the town, leveling homes and causing significant damage. The tornado reportedly carried bodies of people and cattle over half a mile, resulting in 6 fatalities and 33 injuries. The tornado was part of a larger outbreak that included other violent tornadoes, with three of them affecting areas south of Springfield, Illinois. The Taylorville tornado is notable for being one of only two F5 tornadoes to affect central or southeast Illinois.</p>

<h1>Grinnell, Iowa</h1>
<p>June 18 1882</p>

<br><p>On June 18, 1882, one of Iowa’s deadliest tornadoes would touch down northwest of Des Moines. Before it touched down, residents said "the northern sky was hung with conical, downard-pointing clouds" likely referring to mammatus clouds. The tornado touched down at night time, so many people did not see it coming, likely the reasoning behind the 68 fatalities. It was illuminated by lightning and was visible when it approached Grinnell. Students at Grinnell College stated what seemed to be  2 tornadoes forming, possibly referencing subvorticies or sattelite tornadoes. Almost half of the deaths associated with the tornado occurred in Grinnell. It killed about 27 more people moving through Malcom before finally dissipating.</p>

<h1>Rochester, Minnesota</h1>
<p>August 21 1883</p>

<br><p>On August 21, 1883, one of Minnesota’s worst tornadoes would touch down west of the town of Rochester. The tornado would begin moving east toward the town, destroying farmsteads and sadly killing a few people. It then tore through the southern portion of Rochester, obliterating farms and houses in it’s wake, ending up killing about 31 in Rochester alone.</p>

<h1>Oakville, Indiana</h1>
<p>April 1 1884</p>

<br><p>On April 1, 1884, a tornado formed west of the town of Oakville, Indiana. It tracked eastward and struck the town, causing widespread destruction, unfortunately killing eight people and reducing most of the town to rubble. Contemporary meteorologists considered it one of the most intense tornadoes ever observed, though this is unlikely today. According to the newspaper, the funnel was a ‘quarter of a mile wide.’</p>

<p>June 15 1892</p>

<br><p>On June 15, 1892 a tornado touched down in southern Minnesota and began traveling due east. While it did not directly hit towns, it did strike homes or farmsteads, which it obliterated, throwing large timbers miles away. It struck a school district, unfortunately killing 3. It continued east, killing 9 others. This was also part of a tornado family and was about 500 meters wide.</p>

<br><p>On May 22, 1893, a tornado touched down near Willow Springs, Winconsin. It traveled northeast and impacted the town of Darlington, ravaging houses and farmhouses in it’s wake. The tornado unfortunately killed 2 and exited Darlington and destroyed homes and farmsteads along Moscow Township and finally lifting.</p>

<h1>Pomeroy, Iowa</h1>
<p>July 6 1893</p>

<br><p>On July 6, 1893, a tornado touched down northwest of the town of Pomeroy, Iowa, and immediately impacted 2 farmsteads which it completely flattened. It impacted a schoolhouse which also was completely destroyed. According to records, it dug up 40 feet of metal pipes from the earth underneath the school. The tornado continued marching southeast, destroying many farmhouses with families sheltering in their basements, sadly killing its first victims, one was thrown dozens of yards away with a fractured skull. It continued ravaging over open farmfields, killing dozens upon hundreds of cattle and livestock and laying them in rows, known as wind rowing, before completely destroying an iron corn sheller. The storm then approached Pilot Rock Bridge. The iron truss reinforced bridge spanning 120 feet above a river was completely shattered and thrown into the river to the north. This would be its most well-known feat of damage. When it reached Pomeroy, the entire town almost ceased to exist, homes were slabbed and destroyed. Many victims were thrown from their basements, before the tornado dissipated southeast of Pomeroy.</p>

<h1>Plum Creek, Iowa</h1>
<p>September 22 1894</p>

<br><p>On September 21-22, 1894 a small tornado outbreak would affect parts of Iowa and Minnesota. One of the tornadoes produced was a tornado that completely destroyed parts of Kossuth Country. The tornado formed north of Whittemore and moved east before doing a sharp turn to the north, sweeping away farmfields in it’s wake, eventually leading to homes, unfortunately killing 13. This outbreak was also likely a family of tornadoes.</p>

<h1>Halstead, Kansas</h1>
<p>May 1 1895</p>

<br><p>On May 1, 1895, a tornado touched down south of Halstead and began tracking northeast, immediately impacting 3 houses, which it absolutley obliterated. When it entered Halstead, it "uproofed" houses in the area, unfortunately killing many. It neared the school district, in which teacher Mr. Hege saw the storm approaching and rushed his students into the cellar. Luckily nobody was killed when it struck the school, which was completely gone when they came out. It exited town and continued north before dissipating.</p>

<h1>_________________________</h1>
<h1>Halstead, Kansas</h1>
<p>May 1 1895</p>

A mile-wide multi-vortex tornado formed two miles to the northeast of Ireton in the southern part of Center Township. Eyewitness testimonies describe the path of the first subvortex with surprising detail. The first fatalities occurred when a schoolhouse was hit and destroyed by this subvortex at the intersection of 440th Street and Fig Avenue. A mile and a quarter to the northeast, a family was caught as they were climbing into their cellar, suffering injuries and one fatality. Another school was destroyed outright at the intersection of 420th Street and Garfield Avenue. The occupants would suffer horrific injuries, and one student and the teacher would perish. Tragically, the teachers at these first two schools to be struck were siblings, and both suffered the same fate. A mile to the north, three more fatalities occurred. Yet another school would be destroyed a further mile to the north. Fortunately, the teacher had been monitoring the approaching storm and dismissed her students early. Another fatality would occur on a farm along Grant Avenue. At the intersection of Grant Avenue and 360th Street, another cluster of farms would be hit, resulting in one more fatality. Another school was destroyed at this location, but all occupants survived. Despite reducing in width as it paralleled what is today Highway 75, the tornado was still strong enough to completely destroy a newly built farm home. The tornado would dissipate after causing damage to a handful of buildings in Perkins. Several farms along the path were destroyed to such a degree that little debris remained where the structures originally stood. A common theme among written accounts of this tornado was a layer of mud up to two inches thick being left in some spots by the tornado. Notably, this was the only tornado in the history of Iowa to kill students or staff in schools.
